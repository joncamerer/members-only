This is part of the Forms Project in The Odin Project's Ruby on Rails Curriculum. Find it at [The Odin Project.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/authentication)

From The Odin Project:

"In this project, you'll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write embarrassing posts about non-members. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

This will be a chance for you to "roll your own" authentication system, very similar to how you did in the tutorial. As usual, we will be focusing on data and function, not style."
